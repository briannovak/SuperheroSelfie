# Superhero Selfie!

See yourself as SUPER! Wear 3D masks in augmented reality and become the superhero of your dreams.

## Project Description
Created in under two weeks as my capstone project for the Galvanize Web Development Immersive Program. A requirement of the project was to learn a new technology and I chose Swift/XCode. Using their integrated Augmented Reality libraries I was able to overlay masks onto the 3D mesh model of the user's face as well as put a 3D mask in front of the user's face to create the illusion of wearing a mask in the digital space.

# Installation
After forking and cloning this repo: 
```
Open the SuperheroSelfie.xcodeproj project file in XCode and
"side-load" the project onto an iPhone X (The TrueDepth 
Camera of the iPhone X is currently required for facial 
mapping and augmented reality compatibility).
```
